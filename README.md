## Introduction

Web-based client-side Quansheng firmware patcher written in Javascript and HTML using [Bootstrap 4.6.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/), jQuery and parts of the [SB Admin 2 Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2).  
It is based on the discoveries by the many contributors in the [uvmod-kitchen](https://github.com/amnemonic/Quansheng_UV-K5_Firmware/tree/main/uvmod_kitchen) and implements the same functionality in a modular and flexible javascript structure. 

Visitors can generate a patched firmware image by selecting the desired patches. Patches modify the firmware on a binary level and can accept user input to customize variables. A custom base image can be supplied to allow support for mods that are compiled and linked directly into the firmware. 

## Mod development

Clone this repository and execute `python3 -m http.server` or `python -m http.server` in the root directory for an instant local web server, allowing easy testing.  
Mods are defined in [mods.js](mods.js), with an example mod to outline the pattern.  
Also __refer to the helper functions and documentation in__ [modframework.js](js/modframework.js).  

The supported format for binary data is in the format of a hex string __without separators__. You can use find and replace to remove all `\x` from a regular hex string or directly export the correct format from a bytes object in python using `print(''.join('%02x'%i for i in BYTES_OBJECT))`.
